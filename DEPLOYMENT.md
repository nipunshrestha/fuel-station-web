# COMP3120: Advanced Web Development
## Assignment 2: Fuel-Checker

### Deployment

The project has been deployed in the following link:
https://fuel-checker.herokuapp.com/

### How to run and build the project

For new developers continuing the project. We recommend using yarn instead of npm as yarn has been chosen as this project's package manager. However, if you're insistent on using npm, be sure to delete the yarn.lock file. 

Additionally if you use npm, simply replace "yarn" in any of the commands mentioned in this document with "npm" when running the commands.

Run "yarn run dev" in the terminal to start the back end of this project. This will pull the data from the database. 

Run "yarn start" in the terminal to start the frontend on your local computer.


### Testing the project

To run the created tests be sure follow the following instructions:

For the backend testing run "yarn run test"
For the frontend testing run "yarn run testreact"

### Continuous Integration

We have yet to implement continuous integration into the project.
